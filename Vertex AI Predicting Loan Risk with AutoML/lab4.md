## Vertex AI Predicting Loan Risk with AutoML

## Overview 
This lab uses Vertex AI, the unified AI platform on Google Cloud to train and deploy a ML model. Vertex AI offers two options on one platform to build a ML model: a codeless solution with AutoML and a code-based solution with Custom Training using Vertex Workbench. We used AutoML in this lab.
In this lab we build a ML model to determine whether a particular customer will repay a loan.

### Objectives

-	Upload a dataset to Vertex AI.
-	Train a machine learning model with AutoML.
-	Evaluate the model performance.
-	Deploy the model to an endpoint.
-	Get predictions.
