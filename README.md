# Google Cloud & Istanbul Data Science Academy Data Analyst V.2 Boostcamp Portfolio


Hello! I'm Ceren, and I participated in the Google Cloud & Istanbul Data Science Academy Data Analyst V.2 Boostcamp to enhance my skills in data analytics and visualization. Throughout this bootcamp, I completed a series of lab studies on the Google Cloud Platform and gained hands-on experience in data visualization using Looker Studio. The boostcamp and these studies have significantly contributed to the enhancement of my abilities in the field of data analytics and visualization.

In this GitHub repository, I aim to showcase my experience by sharing the studies I conducted during the bootcamp, as well as the projects I created using Looker Studio. My portfolio primarily focuses on lab studies conducted on the Google Cloud Platform and data visualization using Looker Studio, covering a variety of datasets.
