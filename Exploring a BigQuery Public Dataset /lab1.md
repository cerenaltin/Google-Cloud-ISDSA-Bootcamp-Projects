# Exploring a BigQuery Public Dataset

## Overview 
BigQuery is Google's enterprise data warehouse solution, offering super-fast SQL queries on massive datasets using Google's infrastructure. Accessible through the Cloud Console, CLI, or REST API, BigQuery simplifies data storage and querying. It enables tasks like querying public datasets, creating custom tables, loading data, and executing queries. With its user-friendly web UI, BigQuery streamlines data management and analysis, making it a valuable tool for businesses seeking efficient data handling solutions.

In this task, We load a public dataset, USA Names, into BigQuery, then query the dataset to determine the most common names in the US between 1910 and 2013. After that we create a custom table, load data into it, and then run a query against the table.

## Objectives
- Query a public dataset
-	Create a custom table
-	Load data into a table
-	Query a table


- Query bigquery-public-data.usa_names.usa_1910_2013 for the name and gender of the babies in this dataset, and then list the top 10 names in descending order.
